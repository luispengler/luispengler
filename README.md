- Hello, my name is LuÃ­s Spengler. 
- Currently as I write this, I am a Junior High School student enrolled in electrotechnology vocational program integrated to High School.
- I am really interested in learning more about physics, it's my favorite thing in life since I was 8! However, over the past few years, I got really interested in computers, with part of my attention directed towards Linux, some scripting and somewhere I can gather physics and computer science: **A quantum computer.**
